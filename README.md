# Web Application Penetration Testing Beginner's Roadmap

Hi! I'm **Saad Zia**. I am currently working as a Cyber Security Engineer . I am creating this repository for everyone to contribute as to guide the young and enthusiastic minds for starting their career in web application penetration testing. More content will be added regularly. Keep following. So let's get started!

***NOTE:*** The web application penetration testing landscape has changed since the last few years. The issues we used to find easily an year ago would not be easy now. Automation is being used rigorously and most of the "*low hanging fruits*" are being duplicated if you are out of luck. If you want to start doing web penetration testing, you will have to be determined to be consistent and focused, as the competition is very high.

- **What is a Web?**
	 - The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably. However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.

 - **What is Web Application Penetration Testing?**
	 - Web application penetration testing is the process of using penetration testing techniques on a web application to detect its vulnerabilities. It is similar to a penetration test and aims to break into the web application using any penetration attacks or threats. Web application penetration testing works by using manual or automated penetration tests to identify any vulnerability, security flaws or threats in a web application. The tests involve using/implementing any of the known malicious penetration attacks on the application. The penetration tester exhibits/fabricates attacks and environment from an attackerâ€™s perspective, such as using SQL injection tests. The web application penetration testing key outcome is to identify security weakness across the entire web application and its components (source code, database, back-end network). It also helps in prioritizing the identified vulnerabilities and threats, and possible ways to mitigate them..
